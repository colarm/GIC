The aim: To explore meth.s for enhan.g interp..
without perf..e sacrifice. 
Methods were devided to 3 domains: . . .
RQ: . . .

Secondary, quantitative
evaluates 3 dom ... accuracy, trust, and stability
ofcourse, interp.. is also a major metric. 


First Fig. 
-> relationship b.tw.n interp and num of leaves
more leaves means higher comlexity -> lower interp
Since ano.. Fig. shows ... no signi.. diff among
LR, DT, and RF. 
So, model sim... is a good choice to ... 

Second Fig.
-> Diff local ... algo.. have diff characters. 
ILIME -> balance
LIME and SHAP -> efficiency
Anchor -> compatible with .py .r .java

Third Fig. 
-> Less feature -> better accuracy
I was surprised bcz: I tend ...
However, ..research.. FS algo elaminate interfering .

Conclusion
MS reduce the interp. directly, 
No signi. perf. sacrifice
LIT: In general senario -> ILIME
real-time: LIME, SHAP
Java: Anchor
FS: It's import. to choose an approprate FS algo
reduce model feature signi. , elaminate interfering...
