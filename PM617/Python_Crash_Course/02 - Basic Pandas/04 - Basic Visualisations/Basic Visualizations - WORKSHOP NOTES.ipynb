Visualizations are arguably the best way to communicate your insights to others. Moreover, they can help you in your exploratory data analysis (EDA) by highlighting certain patterns in your data and surfacing outliers or errors. Depending on the type of data, you'll want to use different visualizations. For now, we'll focus on discrete and continuous data.   \n","\n","**Discrete** basically means that it can only take specific values within a range. For example, if you recorded the gender of every person in this class, you'd have a discrete number of men or women. It would not make sense to say that \"there are 1.98 men\" or \"20.2 women.\" But if you were to take everyone's height, that would be a **continuous** variable. Because you can have a student that's 5 feet and 11.322243 inches tall. Or a woman that is 5 feet and 4.902929930 inches tall. In other words, continuous data is not restricted to specific, separate values. \n","\n","\n","Python has _plenty_ of data visualization libraries.
